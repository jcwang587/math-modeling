# Data Visualization

MATLAB’s built-in `plot` function is a straightforward yet versatile tool for generating a range of basic visualizations. It is most commonly used to create line plots, scatter plots, and other simple chart types. 

`Plotly` is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library that provides powerful functions for creating interactive graphs and conducting statistical analysis in various programming languages, including Python, R, and MATLAB. By using `Plotly`’s MATLAB library, for example, users can produce professional quality charts (such as box plots, histograms, and distribution plots) that enhance both the clarity and engagement of data presentations.
