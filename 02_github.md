# Git

**Git** is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers collaboratively developing software. A version control system is essential for modern coding development. In this chapter, students will start a personal GitHub to store their code and set up a Git plugin in MATLAB.

## Join Github

To get started with GitHub, you'll need to create a free personal account and verify your email address.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/.
2. Click **Sign up**.
3. Follow the prompts to create your personal account.
