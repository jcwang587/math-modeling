# Preface

Math Modeling is a core undergraduate course covering the development and analysis of mathematical models for engineering systems. The course includes lectures and lab sessions. The lectures teach students math theory and applications based on pen-and-paper analysis, while the lab sessions are hands-on sessions that train students to use computer-based tools (e.g., MATLAB) to solve problems numerically.

Due to the many objectives in the constrained syllabus, a common complaint from students is the lack of sufficient practice with and exposure to state-of-the-art computational tools, including and beyond MATLAB. Aligned with CACHE (Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering)’s goal of *bridging the gap between theory and practice in chemical engineering education by equipping students with cutting-edge computational tools and simulations*,{cite:p}`cache` this supplementary course emphasizes the importance of teaching students how to translate and apply their coursework knowledge into solving classic chemical engineering problems using latest computational tools.

As detailed in this book, seven modules have been designed, focusing on the main application of metabolic modeling, described in subsections from Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to Spatiotemporal FBA. This interdisciplinary application spans a wide spectrum of core chemical engineering principles, including thermodynamics, transport processes, kinetics, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and coding. The outcome of this series of modules is an in-silico model of a Petri dish. For solution tools, we will apply the professional optimization solver Gurobi through the MATLAB interface. Moreover, students will learn to use state-of-the-art Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (DFBA) packages, such as DFBALab and COMETS. These modules also develop students’ literature-searching skills as they search for appropriate Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GSMM) to simulate with their code.

In addition, we will introduce Plotly, one of the most widely used interactive graphing packages, to explore solutions and communicate results with visual insights. Other useful tools, such as the MATLAB Live Editor, Machine Learning Toolbox, GUI interface, and actxserver, will also be included. Check out the content pages bundled with this book to see more.
